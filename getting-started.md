# Introduction

In this session we will be looking at the code behind webpages, editing that code and seeing what changes. 

## Step 1

Open the [Mozilla X-Ray Goggles](https://goggles.mozilla.org) page in a new tab.

You can either right click the link and select open in a new tab, or copy the link below. 

```
goggles.mozilla.org
```

## Step 2 

Install Goggles by dragging the pink bar onto your bookmarks bar. You can open the bookmarks bar by selecting the 
"Show Bookmarks Bar" in the chrome browser menu or by pressing "command - shift- b" on the keyboard.

You should see "X-Ray Goggles" appear as a link on your bookmarks bar.

You can test it is installed correctly by opening a new tab, navigating to [example.com](example.com) and clicking the 
X-Ray Goggles link on your bookmarks bar. This should activate X-Ray Goggles on the webpage. 

If it is correctly installed, you should see brighly coloured boxes appear as you move your mouse around.

## Step 3 

We are now going to edit some HTML code using X-Ray Goggles. 

Go to the [X-Ray Goggles tutorial page](https://goggles.mozilla.org/ftu).

```
goggles.mozilla.org/ftu
```

Click the X-Ray Goggles button on your bookmarks bar and you should see the tutorial page. 

Move your mouse onto the image in the centre, where you should see the word figure. 

Click the image. A box should appear at the bottom of the page with some code inside it. 

Change the word "fox" to "bird" and you should see the image change.
