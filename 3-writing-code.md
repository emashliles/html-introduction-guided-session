# Writing Code - Dinner Menu

In this exercise we will be creating a digital dinner menu.

## Step 0

Download and install the text editor atom from [atom.io](https://atom.io/)

## Step 1

Create a new file on your computer called "menu.html".

Copy and paste the following code into it.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
 </body>
</html>
```

## Step 2 

In this code there is a `<head>` section and a `<body>` section. 

All html pages require these sections. 

The `<head>` section is data about the webpage, including the title of the page as it should appear in the browser
header, links to the css to style the page with and data for search engines to help them rank your page. 

The `<body>` section is where the content of the page goes - in other words what you see in the browser window.

We are going to change the title of the page.

Find the bit of code inside the `<head>` tag that looks like this:

```
<title>Made with Thimble</title>
```

## Step 3

Now we are going to change the code in the `<body>` to show our dinner menu.

Change the contents of the `<h1>` tag to say "Menu". You should see the changes reflected on the right hand side.

## Step 4

We are going to keep it simple and have two courses. 

For each course we are going to need a heading and some text underneath. 

Add the following code on a new line underneath your `<h1>` tag.

```
 <h2>Main Course</h2>
```

As you can see, when the page is rendered on the right hand side, the text you have just added is a little smaller than the text in the `<h1>` tag.

There are 6 different heading tags you can use, from 1 the largest to 6 the smallest. 

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>

## Step 5

We are now going to add the dish to our course. 

Underneath your `<h2>` tag, add the following code:

```
<p>Spaghetti Bolognese</p>
```

This is the `<p>` tag, which stands for paragraph. 

## Step 6 

Using what you learned to add some more courses to your menu. 

Congratulations, you wrote some code!
