# Writing Code - Dinner Menu

In this exercise we will be creating a digital dinner menu.


## Step 1

Go to [thimble.mozilla.org](https://thimble.mozilla.org)

Click the "Start a project from scratch" button

## Step 2 

You will see some code already there. In it there is a `<head>` section and a `<body>` section. 

All html pages require these sections. 

The `<head>` section is data about the webpage, including the title of the page as it should appear in the browser
header, links to the css to style the page with and data for search engines to help them rank your page. 

We are going to change the title of the page.

Find the bit of code inside the `<head>` tag that looks like this:

```
<title>Made with Thimble</title>
```

## Step 3

Now we are going to change the code in the `<body>` to show our dinner menu.

Change the contents of the `<h1>` tag to say "Menu". You should see the changes reflected on the right hand side.

## Step 4

We are going to keep it simple and have two courses. 

For each course we are going to need a heading and some text underneath. 

Add the following code on a new line underneath your `<h1>` tag.

```
 <h2>Main Course</h2>
```

As you can see, when the page is rendered on the right hand side, the text you have just added is a little smaller than the text in the `<h1>` tag.

There are 6 different heading tags you can use, from 1 the largest to 6 the smallest. 

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
