# Developer Tools

In this session we will use the inbuilt developer tools to inspect and edit real websites. 

## Step 1

Go to [example.com] (example.com). 

## Step 2 

Open the developer tools on your browser. In chrome, you can do this by right clicking on the webpage body and choosing
the "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" option. Once you do this, you should be able to see the page's code. 

## Step 3

Carefully read the code that is between the <body> tags. Even better, read it out loud to someone - even the punctuation 
marks.
