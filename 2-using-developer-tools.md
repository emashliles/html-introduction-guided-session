# Developer Tools

In this session we will use the inbuilt developer tools to inspect and edit real websites. 

## Step 1

Go to [example.com] (example.com). 

## Step 2 

Open the developer tools on your browser. In chrome, you can do this by right clicking on the webpage body and choosing
the "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" option. Once you do this, you should be able to see the page's code. 

## Step 3

Carefully read the code that is between the `<body>` tags. Even better, read it out loud to someone - even the punctuation 
marks. 

## Step 4 

We are going to edit the title of the webpage.

Don't be concrned about this, it will only affect the website on your machine. 

Double click the text between the `<h1>` tags. 

When you see the text appear inside a box, start typing the new title inside this box then press enter. (If you
are stuck for a title try "Hello, World.")

You should see the text change on the page. Hurrah!

## Step 5

Edit the text in the paragraph by double clicking again then making your changes, pressing enter to save. 

## Step 6 

We are now going to edit a link.

Find the code that looks like this.

```
<a href="http://www.iana.org/domains/example">More information...</a>
```

This is a link. You can see the site it is linking to inside the angle brackets this time. 

Choose a website to change the link to. An example could be the google homepage.

Change the code so it links to another website. It is important to include the "http://" part too. 

```
<a href="http://google.com">More information...</a>
```

Click the link to check it works.

Congratualtions, you just edited code using real life developer tools.
