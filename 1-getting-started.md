# Introduction

In this session we will be looking at the code behind webpages, editing that code and seeing what changes. 

## Step 1

Open the [Mozilla X-Ray Goggles](https://goggles.mozilla.org) page in a new tab.

You can either right click the link and select open in a new tab, or copy the link below. 

```
goggles.mozilla.org
```

## Step 2 

Install Goggles by dragging the pink bar onto your bookmarks bar. You can open the bookmarks bar by selecting the 
"Show Bookmarks Bar" in the chrome browser menu or by pressing "command - shift- b" on the keyboard.

You should see "X-Ray Goggles" appear as a link on your bookmarks bar.

You can test it is installed correctly by opening a new tab, navigating to [example.com](example.com) and clicking the 
X-Ray Goggles link on your bookmarks bar. This should activate X-Ray Goggles on the webpage. 

If it is correctly installed, you should see brighly coloured boxes appear as you move your mouse around.

## Step 3 

We are now going to edit some HTML code using X-Ray Goggles. 

Go to the [X-Ray Goggles tutorial page](https://goggles.mozilla.org/ftu).

```
goggles.mozilla.org/ftu
```

Click the X-Ray Goggles button on your bookmarks bar and you should see the tutorial page. 

Move your mouse onto the image in the centre, where you should see the word figure. 

Click the image. A box should appear at the bottom of the page with some code inside it. 

Change the word "fox" to "bird" and you should see the image change.

Congratulations - you just editied some code! 

Keep going though - change the word "dino" to "fox".

To stop editing the image, click the green update button.

## Step 4 

We are now going to edit some text. 

Move your mouse over the text at the top of the page until you see the word "div" in the corner, and click when you can see it. 

The following code should appear in the editing box. 

```
<div class="remix-me">
  <h1>What's my name?</h1>
  <p>
    This tutorial walks you through a mix-and-match game to learn about the key features of X-Ray Goggles. With
    X-Ray Goggles activated, you can change the text and switch out the different dino, fox, and bird sections to
    create a new web page featuring your own animal friend.
  </p>
</div>
```

Edit the text between <h1> and </h1> to name the animal you have created with images, taking great care not to remove the angle brackets ("<" and ">").

Edit the between <p> and </p> to give a one sentence bio for your creature.

(If you are stuck for ideas, favorite food is a good one.) 

Congratulations! You edited your first web page! Well done.
