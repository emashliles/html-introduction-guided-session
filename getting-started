# Introduction

In this session we will be looking at the code behind webpages, editing that code and seeing what changes. 

## Step 1

Open the [Mozilla X-Ray Goggles](https://goggles.mozilla.org) page in a new tab.

You can either right click the link and select open in a new tab, or copy the link below. 

```
goggles.mozilla.org
```

## Step 2 

Install Goggles by dragging the pink bar onto your bookmarks bar. You can open the bookmarks bar by selecting the 
"Show Bookmarks Bar" in the chrome browser menu or by pressing "command - shift- b" on the keyboard.

You should see "X-Ray Goggles" appear as a link on your bookmarks bar.

You can test it is installed correctly by opening a new tab, navigating to [example.com](example.com) and clicking the 
X-Ray Goggles link. 

If it is correctly installed, you should see brighly coloured boxes appear as you move your mouse around.
